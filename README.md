<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There's a lot of automated scheduling programs out there. Some created by companies internally while others encompass full solutions like Workday. We want to create a product that is modular in its design. What I mean by that is, we want to give more parameters on which a schedule would be automatically generated. Ideally, this will take the form of tens, if not, near a hundred different settings that play into the algorithm, based on the desired outcome of the user.

Where are we now:
* Basic front-end implementation of schedule
* Basic implementation of algorithm
* Database configuration for storing outputted schedule data and sending that to the front-end

This is currently at its minimal viable prototype. As of writing this readme, we've only been constructing this for about three weeks. This will continue to be built over the next few months. With that, we're hoping to create a completely functioning design based on our requirements list.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The general purpose of this project is to create a scheduler that automatically generates employee schedules accurately. The usage would depend on what our target demographic is. Currently, we're looking to be a more affordable alternative to the solutions out there. As this may change, there can't be any absolutes given.
